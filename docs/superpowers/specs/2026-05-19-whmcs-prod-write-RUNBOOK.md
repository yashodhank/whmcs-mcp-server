# WHMCS MCP Production-Write — Operations Runbook (Tracks G & F)

Companion to `2026-05-19-whmcs-prod-write-enablement-design.md`. Covers the
scoped Cowork consumer (Track G) and the **prep-only** production canary
(Track F). Nothing here auto-runs a production mutation.

## 0. Current posture (after this branch, before any env change)

Production is **SEALED**. Verified by `tests/write/executionGate.test.ts`
keystone tests + `tests/tools/writeFlow.prodsafety.test.ts`: with no new env,
a production execute returns `action_not_prod_authorized`, `whmcs.mutate`
never called — byte-identical to the legacy absolute deny.

## 1. Track G — Claude Cowork scoped consumer (example, synthetic token)

Add ONE `execution_allowed` consumer to `MCP_CONSUMER_REGISTRY`. **Narrow by
action.** No god-mode. The raw token lives only in env (and the caller); the
registry stores its sha256.

Generate a token + hash (do NOT commit the raw token):

```bash
RAW="$(openssl rand -hex 24)"          # the bearer token Cowork sends as auth_token
echo "$RAW"                             # store in your secret manager / claude.json env
printf '%s' "$RAW" | shasum -a 256      # the token_sha256 for the registry
```

`MCP_CONSUMER_REGISTRY` entry (JSON; `<SHA>` = the digest above):

```json
[{
  "id": "claude-cowork-ops",
  "token_sha256": "<SHA>",
  "allowedScopes": ["read"],
  "defaultContract": "ops_operator",
  "allowedContracts": ["ops_operator"],
  "allowedActions": [],
  "writeCapability": "execution_allowed",
  "allowedWriteScopes": ["client_note:write"],
  "envRestrictions": [],
  "anonymous": false
}]
```

- Start with **`client_note:write` only** in `allowedWriteScopes`. Add
  `ticket:create` / `ticket:reply` / `ticket:status` only at S5.
- **Do NOT** add `billing:*` write scopes here until S7 (money tier).
- `execution_allowed` is necessary but **not sufficient** — the action must
  also be in `MCP_PROD_WRITE_AUTHORIZED` and pass risk-tier policy.

## 2. Environment reference (all default to SEALED)

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `MCP_PROD_WRITE_AUTHORIZED` | `` (empty) | Per-action prod allowlist. Empty ⇒ nothing executes in prod. |
| `MCP_WRITE_KILL_SWITCH` | `false` | `true`/`1` ⇒ instant global seal, beats everything. |
| `MCP_WRITE_AUDIT_PATH` | `` (in-memory) | JSONL durable audit. **Required** (config fails fast) once `MCP_PROD_WRITE_AUTHORIZED` is non-empty. |
| `MCP_WRITE_IDEMPOTENCY_PATH` | `` (in-memory) | Durable replay guard across restart. |
| `MCP_PROD_HIGH_RISK_PER_ACTION_CAP` | `0` | High-risk per-action cap. 0 ⇒ all money actions denied. |
| `MCP_PROD_HIGH_RISK_DAILY_CAP` | `0` | High-risk per-(action,day) cap. 0 ⇒ denied. |

Config also **fails fast** if `MCP_PROD_WRITE_AUTHORIZED` contains a
`PROD_NEVER_EXECUTABLE` action, or is non-empty without an audit path.

## 3. Track F — production canary readiness (S4, do NOT auto-run)

The AddClientNote-only canary is **prepared, not executed**. It requires an
explicit, separate human decision to set the env below. Until then production
stays sealed.

**Pre-canary checklist**
1. Track G consumer added with `allowedWriteScopes: ["client_note:write"]`.
2. `MCP_WRITE_AUDIT_PATH` + `MCP_WRITE_IDEMPOTENCY_PATH` set to durable paths
   on persistent storage.
3. `MCP_WRITE_KILL_SWITCH=false`, caps left at `0`.
4. Rebuild (`npm run build`) + restart the MCP (it runs from `dist/`).

**Canary enable (one action only):**
```
MCP_ENV=production
MCP_MODE=full
MCP_PROD_WRITE_AUTHORIZED=AddClientNote
```
Then, via Cowork: draft → validate → approve → execute a single
`client_note:write` against a known internal/test client; confirm the note in
WHMCS admin and in the durable audit JSONL. **Roll back** by clearing
`MCP_PROD_WRITE_AUTHORIZED` (or `MCP_WRITE_KILL_SWITCH=1`).

**Do NOT** add ticket/billing/service/domain/payment actions to the prod
allowlist until the note canary has succeeded and been reviewed (S5+). Money
actions (S7) additionally require: a real human approver via
`approve_write_intent`, non-zero caps, and durable audit (enforced by config +
the authorizer; proven in the high-risk test suite).

## 4. Kill switch (instant seal, any time)

Set `MCP_WRITE_KILL_SWITCH=1` (or `true`) and restart — every write intent is
denied `kill_switch_engaged` regardless of allowlist/approval. It is the first
gate checked.

## 5. Spike 0 + Track E — RESOLVED (2026-05-20)

Dev WHMCS9 (`localhost:8890`) was unblocked via
`deploy/whmcs-test/post-install-fixup.sh` (whitelisted `192.168.65.1` +
`127.0.0.1`, dev-only).

**Spike 0 = `unsupported`** (definitive, probed on dev WHMCS9):
- `GetPromotions` → `success` (63 promotions) — promotion **read** API works.
- `AddPromotion` → `Invalid API Action: "addpromotion" is not a valid API action`.
- `UpdatePromotion` → `Invalid API Action`.

⇒ No safe promotion *create/update* API exists in this WHMCS. **`promotion:create`
is deliberately NOT in the codebase** (correctly gated; the pre-agreed fallback
stands): **promotions are created manually in WHMCS admin; the MCP only
reads/verifies** (a `GetPromotions`-backed read tool is a possible future
enhancement, out of scope for this prod-write epic). **No DB-write promotion
automation in production.**

**Track E = PASS** (live dev proof, `scripts/track-e-proof.ts`): with
`MCP_ENV=local`, `MCP_MODE=full`, a synthetic `execution_allowed` consumer and
`AddClientNote` runtime-authorized, the registered `draft→validate→approve→
execute` chain performed a **real** WHMCS mutation on dev
(`AddClientNote` → `noteid 38`), and a second `execute` of the same intent was
**refused** (`intent_not_approved`, no second mutation) — confirming the
deny-by-default authorizer allows only when every gate passes and blocks
replay.

**Corrections to earlier read-tool-limited statements** (raw WHMCS API, via
`GetProducts`, exposes more than the MCP `list_products` wrapper):
- A native **`slug`** field DOES exist on products (e.g. pid 482 →
  `"slug":"vps-l-ssd"`, plus `product_url`, `gid`). Deterministic plan
  matching can key on the native slug — the earlier "no slug" conclusion was a
  `list_products`-wrapper artifact.
- Product **pricing** IS available via `GetProducts` (the 6/12-month-cycle
  pricing question is answerable there). The MCP `list_products` tool omits
  both — a future read-tool enhancement, **out of scope** for this epic.

## 6. Price restore operations (`service:price_restore`)

A narrow, governed, audited path to restore a service's `recurringamount`
through `UpdateClientProduct`. Production stays sealed unless explicitly
allowlisted. See the implementation spec at
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-20-service-price-restore-design.md` for design
detail.

### Env for prod activation (operator action)

```
MCP_PROD_WRITE_AUTHORIZED=service:price_restore
MCP_PROD_HIGH_RISK_PER_ACTION_CAP=20000   # max |new−old| delta per target
MCP_PROD_HIGH_RISK_DAILY_CAP=50000        # sum of executed deltas per UTC day
```

> **Authorize by SCOPE, not action.** `service:price_restore` and
> `service:domain_rename` BOTH map to the WHMCS action `UpdateClientProduct`.
> The allowlist matches an entry against the intent's action OR its scope, so a
> bare `MCP_PROD_WRITE_AUTHORIZED=UpdateClientProduct` entry (BROAD grant)
> silently authorizes BOTH scopes at once. List the scope string to gate them
> independently — only put `UpdateClientProduct` if you intend to enable every
> scope on that action.

A consumer with `writeCapability='execution_allowed'` and
`allowedWriteScopes=['service:price_restore']` must also exist in
`MCP_CONSUMER_REGISTRY`.

### Worked example — client 50 (svc 555/569/586) ₹45,000 → ₹31,350

1. **Draft** (`draft_write_intent`):
   ```jsonc
   {
     "scope": "service:price_restore",
     "params": {
       "targets": [
         { "serviceid": 555, "new_amount": 31350, "expected_old_amount": 45000 },
         { "serviceid": 569, "new_amount": 31350, "expected_old_amount": 45000 },
         { "serviceid": 586, "new_amount": 31350, "expected_old_amount": 45000 }
       ],
       "dry_run": true
     },
     "naturalKey": "client50-vps-l-ssd-restore",
     "projected_effect": "Restore svc 555/569/586 ₹45000→₹31350/qtr"
   }
   ```
2. **Validate**, **approve** (with a real human approver token).
3. **Execute** (with `dry_run: true`) → review `execution.phase_1.snapshots`.
4. **Draft a fresh intent** identical but omit `dry_run` (or set to `false`).
5. Validate, approve, **execute** (real).
6. Confirm `execution.phase_2.outcomes[*].status === 'verified'`.

### Atomicity contract

- **Phase 1** (always): reads current `recurringamount` per target +
  precondition (`expected_old_amount` match if provided; service status not
  Terminated/Cancelled). Any failure → `precondition_mismatch`, **zero
  mutation performed**.
- **Phase 2** (sequential, fail-fast): each target has its own per-target
  idempotency key (`intent.idempotency_key|serviceid`). A subsequent retry of
  the SAME intent will skip already-done targets via the ledger. Caps:
  per-target `|new−old|` delta capped + running daily sum capped (both reuse
  existing high-risk env). First mutation failure halts later targets.
- **Scope-output assertion**: defense-in-depth verification that the mapper
  produced exactly `{serviceid, recurringamount}` — guards against future
  scope leakage on the powerful `UpdateClientProduct` action.

### Re-seal after completion

```
unset MCP_PROD_WRITE_AUTHORIZED
unset MCP_PROD_HIGH_RISK_PER_ACTION_CAP
unset MCP_PROD_HIGH_RISK_DAILY_CAP
```

Or set `MCP_WRITE_KILL_SWITCH=1` to instantly re-seal everything.

## 7. Service hostname/domain rename (`service:domain_rename`)

A narrow, governed, audited path to change a service's `domain` (hostname)
field through `UpdateClientProduct`. Single-call (one service per intent), risk
tier `medium`. Shares the `UpdateClientProduct` action with `price_restore` —
see the **Authorize by SCOPE, not action** note in §6.

### Env for prod activation (operator action)

```
MCP_PROD_WRITE_AUTHORIZED=service:domain_rename
```

No high-risk caps apply (medium tier). A consumer with
`writeCapability='execution_allowed'` and
`allowedWriteScopes=['service:domain_rename']` must exist in
`MCP_CONSUMER_REGISTRY`. To enable both service scopes, comma-join the scope
strings: `MCP_PROD_WRITE_AUTHORIZED=service:price_restore,service:domain_rename`.

### Worked example — rename svc 42 → `vps42.newhost.example.com`

1. **Draft** (`draft_write_intent`):
   ```jsonc
   {
     "scope": "service:domain_rename",
     "params": {
       "serviceid": 42,
       "domain": "vps42.newhost.example.com",
       "expected_old_domain": "vps42.oldhost.example.com"  // optional guard
     },
     "naturalKey": "svc42-hostname-rename",
     "projected_effect": "Rename svc 42 hostname to vps42.newhost.example.com"
   }
   ```
2. **Validate**, **approve**, **execute**.
3. Confirm `executed === true` and `execution.verified === true`.

### Atomicity / safety contract

- **Domain normalization**: the value is lowercased, trimmed, and a trailing
  FQDN-root dot stripped in ONE place; validation and the sent value agree.
- **Precondition snapshot** (read-only, before any mutation): confirms the
  service exists, is not Terminated/Cancelled, and — if `expected_old_domain`
  is supplied — that the live domain still matches. Any failure →
  `precondition_mismatch`, **zero mutation**.
- **Scope-output assertion**: defense-in-depth check that the mapper produced
  exactly `{serviceid, domain}` before the `UpdateClientProduct` call.
- **Read-back verification**: after the rename, re-reads the service and
  compares the (normalized) `domain` field; `execution.verified` is `true` only
  on an exact match.
- **Idempotency**: keyed by `consumer | action | scope | naturalKey | window`.
  Reusing a `naturalKey` for a DIFFERENT rename within the 5-min window is
  treated as a replay — use a distinct `naturalKey` per distinct rename.

### Re-seal after completion

```
unset MCP_PROD_WRITE_AUTHORIZED
```

Or set `MCP_WRITE_KILL_SWITCH=1` to instantly re-seal everything.
